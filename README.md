# Demand-Forecasting
- We can forecast demand for a supply chain business problem using this machine learning model (LSTM Time Series model). To overcome the issue, this model employs Keras, which makes use of Tensorflow. In the first method, the dataset is split into train and test datasets, and the model is built using the train dataset. The correctness of the model is then evaluated using the test dataset. Instead of splitting the dataset into a train and a test dataset, the second method is utilized to predict the future.
