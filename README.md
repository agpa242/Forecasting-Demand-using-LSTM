# Demand-Forecasting
This machine learning model (LSTM Time Series model) helps us to forecast demand of a supply chain business problem. This model uses Keras which uses tensorflow to solve the problem. 
First approach divides the dataset into train and test dataset, creates the model using train dataset and tests the accuracy against the test dataset. Whereas, the second approach is used to make future predicitions instead of dividing the dataset into train and test dataset.
